    <p>
      I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.txstate.edu/">Texas State University </a> in 2003. At that time I
      owned a home medical equipment company and I chose to keep running that company rather than get a programming job.
      Almost 20 years later and I have refreshed my programming skills and I am now a full stack developer.
